      <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
      <p class="initial-text">Based on the world behind League of Legends, Arcane dives into the delicate balance between the rich, utopian city of Piltover Crest icon Piltover and the seedy, oppressed underground of Zaun Crest icon Zaun. Known across Runeterra as the "city of progress," many of the most brilliant minds call these cities home. But the creation of hextech, a way for any person to control magical energy, threatens that balance. The story follows the origins of two iconic League champions-and the power that will tear them apart. Like the game on which it is based, Arcane is aimed at a "16+" audience and will deal with some more adult subject matter.</p>

      <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
      <p class="final-text">Set in Utopian Piltover and the oppressed underground of Zaun, the story follows the origins of two iconic League of Legends champions and the power that will tear them apart.
        The delicate balance between the rich city of Piltover and the seedy underbelly of Zaun. Tensions between these city-states boil over with the creation of "hextech", a way for any person to control magical energy in Piltover, and in Zaun, a new drug called "shimmer" transforms humans into monsters. The rivalry between the cities splits families and friends as Arcane brings life to the relationships that shape some of League of Legends' famous champions including Vi, Jinx, Caitlyn, Jayce, Viktor, and Ekko.
        In the cities of Piltover and Zaun, tensions rise as inventors, hooligans, politicians, and crime lords grow increasingly dissatisfied with the constraints of a devastated society. With the situation on the verge of being unsustainable, two sisters steal an artifact of immeasurable power. Discovery and danger collide as heroes are born and bonds are broken. Will this power change the world? Or will it lead to ruin? This is the world of Arcane.</p>
